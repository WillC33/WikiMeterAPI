# WikiMeter API

The WikiMeter API is a rate limited ASP Minimal API for my WikiMeter Chromium Extension. It allows users to grab Wikipedia metadata regardless of the CORS origin, circumventing an issue I encounterd during the extension development.

## Features

- **Minimal API:** A simple API, acting as a router for Wikipedia metadata.
  
- **Rate Limited:** Makes use of ASP middleware for efficient rate limiting preventing misuse.

- **.NET Powered:** Utilises the flexibility and efficiency of .NET for expressive and consice code.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP WebAPI:** Making use of the minimal API syntax, we get an efficient, simple API with great middleware.
